Some ran away after one hit, some would run away at seemingly random points in time.","Chica would always run away after being hit, which was predictable. There were a few that I did not believe would run away, but did.","I did not get that impression.","Not particularly. Freddy seemed intent on pursuing me, but I didn't get the impression that it was aggressive.","Not that I could perceive. There were times I was ganged up on when they were in groups, but I did not perceive this as being intentional, I assumed they were all chasing me individually and happened to meet up.","I didn't get that impression. Although, I do think that some ran away at low health, which is a behavior that I exhibited while fighting them.","To me, it seemed that they swapped between pursuing me and running away. I didn't get the impression that they used any other tactics. Running away was often to their detriment, as I could hit them without fear of retaliation.","More variable behavior (for example strafing while attacking similar to the way Minecraft skeletons attack). Have them stop running away and continue fighting when attacked. This will be my answer for all 4.","See my answer for Freddy.","See my answer for Freddy.","See my answer for Freddy."

"2021/04/26 1:46:23 AM GMT","Yes","Foxy (The red fox)","Chica (The yellow chicken)","Bonnie (The purple rabbit)","Freddy (The brown bear)","Chica repeatedly ran away and came back.

Freddy seemed to freeze momentarily after being hit.","Chica consistently attacked once, then ran away and attacked again.

Foxy's behavior seemed to oscillate between attacking and running away at irregular intervals.","Chica felt relatively easy; running away gave me time to prepare my next attack.

Bonnie and Chica also ran away at low health, giving an easy out. It probably wouldn't have been so easy to track them down if the world borders weren't in place.","Freddy did; it felt faster than the rest and didn't run away at low health. The brief idle after being hit actually made it harder to get a second hit on Freddy, since I was expecting it to run forward after the knockback from the sword hit.","The animatronics seemed to only run away to the corners of the map at the same time; one wouldn't run away while others were still willing to fight.","Running away at low health is realistic for human PvP, however a human would run in circles rather than hiding in the exposed corner of the map.","","In general, it might be more interesting to play against the animatronics if they attacked at a reasonable sub-player speed but ran away at their current speed.","","",""

Bonnie ran when low health. Chica tended to run after getting hit and would randomly run back to hit you. Foxy was more of a mystery to me, they tended to run away after getting hit or something.","The most unpredictable was Chica, they would randomly take me by surprise by sharply turning to punch me.","I don't think any were taking it easy, I think Freddy seemed easier to hit stun and make it so he couldn't attack you.","The fight with 5 Bonnies was difficult because they were all very aggressive at full health and when they got low they would run and allow others to fill its place while it heals. I would say Bonnie was the most aggressive.","The Bonnies together seemed to have great synergy.","I think Chica and Bonnie seemed the most human like, running when low or trying to kite the opponent is very human like.","N/A","Maybe make him deal more damage, right now he is easy to kite away from and make it so he barely touches you, so maybe make it so when he is able to get a hit or 2 in those hits will be impactful.","","",""

It would only get aggro-ed when you walk towards it. Freddie only seemed to attack, very basic. ","They all felt pretty predictable by the end. I think I've figured out the just of their patterns","Chica felt kinda easy","Freddy - he would just keep attacking, which is both good and bad","In the team fight, sometimes they would surround me. Also, the Bonnie hoard would let some of their members run away and heal while the rest kept fighting with me.","To an extent. The pathfinding felt a bit basic, and I would expect a little more strafing from a PvP encounter, but overall there were definitely themes. ","Cool mod!","Strafing, but I don't know if you want to dive into pathfinding","It would be interested if Bonnie could heal more quickly when it was deaggro-ed","Mix up if it will run or not. If you know it will run every time it attacks the prediction gets easy. A ranged attack could be interesting.","If you run he'll deaggro, which is not a bad thing but allows you to run away from a fight.

","All appeared to follow the pattern of fleeing after some hits until re-engaged, which made them quite easy to beat when timing strikes right. This is shown especially if they flee into water, such as the puddle in the corner of map 1, as they are now slow enough to strike without dodging much at all.","All felt about the same in terms of difficulty.","All felt about the same in terms of aggression.","Yes, in world 2, the pattern of fleeing made it difficult to kill them at once. As I was forced to move to defeat one, the other (or multiple others) would disengage and begin to roam around, meaning they caught me off-guard on some occasions while I was focused on a different one.","Yes, the fall-back strategy used by them all is similar to PvP players disengaging to eat and heal.","Really the only thing I could think of is boosting the speed of Foxy, as she was extremely fast relative to the other animatronics in the game.","","","","Boost speed."
